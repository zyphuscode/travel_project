# travel_project

##About Project:
 I created this app as a personal blog where I show case my travel experience and picture. This was a fun project where I tried and experimented with different JS libraries for animation and interactions.

## Motivation:
The idea behind this app is to learn different JS libraries and breakpoints for responsiveness using media queries.

The application was built as a part of a learning activity,  but later, i will format this app using a proper backend technology with database.

Tech
Javascript, HTML and CSS

Frontend

HTML
CSS
Backend and authentication Firebase

Future Improvements
I will try to add strong database to store more user data and their progress while using the app. Â© zyphuscode
